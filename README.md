# About
"Star Wars-wiki" is a basic web app created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays data from the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/) using the Fetch API. The webpage allows users to view data for different models in the API (currently only two: people and films), and provides a way to navigate between each model's page to the other models that are displayed. This project was created as part of an assignment to demonstrate proficiency in web development using JavaScript and working with APIs.

# Access
The web app can be run by simply running the 'index.html' after cloning the repo. The web app is also hosted in github pages, and can be easily accessed using the following link:
https://msrezaie.github.io/starwars-wiki/

# UI
The web app has only a signle html page. Styling of the elements in the web page is done with CSS with the help of Bootstrap. In order to view the fetched data of a specific model, users can simply click on a Character's name or a Film's title. Following are the views users will face after accessing the web app: 
## Main View (lists of Characters & Films)
